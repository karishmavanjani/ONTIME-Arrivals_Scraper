# ONTIME-Arrivals_Scraper
Data Source: Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)

*What it achieves*

The selenium code looks into the aspx url- https://transtats.bts.gov/ONTIME/Arrivals.aspx and downloads all flight data available on BTS for New York's JFK airport. 

*Methodology*




Note: Use of selenium is due to the static nature of the url which limits our ability to scrape the website using only Python. Alternatively, Java can be used instead of Python.
