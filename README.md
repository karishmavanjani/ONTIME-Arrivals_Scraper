# ONTIME-Arrivals_Scraper
Data Source: Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)

#What it achieves

The selenium code looks into the aspx url- https://transtats.bts.gov/ONTIME/Arrivals.aspx and downloads all flight available flight data on BTS for the airport, JFK. 

#Methodology

Use of selenium is due to the static nature of the url which limits our ability to scrape the website. 
The same can be achieved through Java but the code dabbles with Python.
